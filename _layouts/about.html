I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I've always been interested in Electronics and Computers, I've got my first computer at the age of 6, it was a [Commodore 128][1] were I did my  first steps in programming by reading computer's manuals. Most of the knowledge I've acquired in the field of computer science was in a self-taught mode, and I like to define myself as a curious person that is always willing to learn new stuff.

Along my career I was exposed to different business as well as different technologies. The programming language that shifted my entire perspective was [Smalltalk][2], it gave me a more philosophical view of programming. 

Interesting projects I've participated include: 

* [PC Oscilloscope][3]
* Data-Mining systems
* Real-time telemetry system
* Data processing and classification systems for [Precision Agriculture][4]
* High transaction website for travel and leisure
* [Parrot VM][5]
