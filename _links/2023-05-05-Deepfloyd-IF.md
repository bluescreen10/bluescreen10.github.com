I had the chance to play with [DeepFloyd IF](https://github.com/deep-floyd/IF), a new text2img model that's designed to create more realistic images and, above all, deal better with text.

After experimenting with SD, Dall-E, and MidJourney for a while, I wasn't sure what to expect from DeepFloyd IF. However, I was genuinely impressed by the results (see the image below) when I inputted the prompt: "A monkey holding a sign that says: I survived the HI revolution."

It took maybe 5 attempts to get the result I wanted, but as you can see, the final output is pretty good.

Just like our primate relatives, we can survive and thrive in the wake of the AI revolution, or learn how to swing from branch to branch.
