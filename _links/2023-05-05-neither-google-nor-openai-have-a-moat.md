title: Neither Google nor OpenAI have a moat

This [article](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither) is making the rounds on the internet. The author makes the case that open-source models are innovating faster than the top closed-source models (Bart, Sydney, and OpenAI).

I believe that in the future, you will run your model like you run your database or web-server in your infrastructure. I think that's possible today, for instance, using [Llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp).
