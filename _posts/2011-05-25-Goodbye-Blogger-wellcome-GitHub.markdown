I've finished migrating my site to [Github Pages][1] from [Blogger][2], the main reason that put me here is [Jekyll][3]. 

Jekyll it's a simple yet powerful blog engine written in Ruby. While the documentation is still poor ( most of the time you end up looking at the source of other Github pages ) it is amazing what you can do with it. 

Now I can blog from my preferred editor [emacs][4], and upload it any time without paying attention to the format since pages are transformed from plain text ( [markdown][5] ) to html by Jekyll. Yeah! I didn't get along with Blogger's editor because of the extra junk it puts on your text.

Another killer feature is the out of the box syntax highlighting for code snippets via [Pygments][6] ( a lexer that supports over 100 languages ).

This is a bit out-of-topic thing, but nowadays Websites - are like a Frankenstein -  built from several fragments integrated together: [Disqus][7], [Google Analytics][8], [Youtube][9], [Twitter][10], and so forth. The point is that I think that's a trend we'll see more and more in the future.
