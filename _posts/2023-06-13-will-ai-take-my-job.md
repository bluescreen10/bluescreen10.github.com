If you've ever lost a job to a toaster, I feel for you. It's tough. But let's be
serious for a moment---the rise of AI is undeniable. Does that mean 
knowledge-based jobs will be replaced by AI? *I don't think so*.

For the sake of argument, let's assume I'm completely wrong and AI does, in 
fact, take every creative job. If that were to happen, and we all morph into 
professional couch potatoes within the next 2-3 years, who's going to cover our 
Netflix subscriptions and pizza delivery? Precisely, no jobs equals no economy.

I've heard speculations about a potential universal income. I don't see that 
happening in a million years, but if it were to come true, you'd be free to 
pursue your interests. That's not a bad outcome.

The most likely scenario is that we will adapt and thrive, just as we did with 
previous technological revolutions. We are a remarkably resilient species. If 
anything, I firmly believe AI will serve as an augmentation tool.

When GPT-4 was [announced](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4), OpenAI included 
results of how the model performed on various types of exams. For instance, it 
passed the BAR exam and would have scored in top 10 percentile. As I said 
before, it will only get better with time.

But does that mean anyone using ChatGPT is now a lawyer? Not exactly. I could 
technically ask it to draft a contract for me, but how would I know if the 
contract is even legal? The issue is that I don't know what I don't know. I 
still need an attorney.

The notion is just as absurd as believing that anyone watching YouTube is now a
plumber. There are literally step-by-step guides to perform any repairs you 
need. Yet, the last time I needed a plumber, I struggled to find one who was 
available.

Knowledge has always been freely available, even before the internet. And it's 
not the only reason we hire experts. We also seek their experience with a 
particular task, the speed at which they can perform it, assurance that if 
something goes wrong, they'll know how to fix it, or simply because we aren't 
interested in doing the task ourselves.

Now, an expert using these tools can significantly boost their productivity. 
Which leads me to another common concern:

Technically, you only need a single employee to run any company. You won't go 
fast, but it's possible.

Companies hire employees to increase efficiency, scale the business, and improve
their pace relative to competitors. You see, competition is like the to the cold
war---you're trying to outdo your enemies. The only difference is that, in this
case, we all have access to the same weapons. If you want to win the war, you 
will need a bigger army.

At every company I've been part of, we've always had more ideas than we had 
capacity to execute them. If these tools become mainstream — which I believe 
they will — they would make products more complex and feature-rich, not cheaper 
and minimalistic.

As someone who uses this technology daily, I can confidently say that while it
 has significantly increased my productivity in some areas, it has made no 
 change in others.

So here's my 2 cents: few jobs will be automated, productivity will
increase, and yes, you will still need to hire a lawyer.
